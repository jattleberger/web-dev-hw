1. ****How many document <head> and <body> elements can a page have? How are these elements different, or what role do they play?****
    You can only have one <head> and <body> element per page. The head elements tell the browser and processor information about the HTML document, such as the title, author, and publication date. The body element is where all of the “meat & potatoes” of the site gets placed.
2. ****Describe the difference between structural and semantic markup.****
    Structural markup are things like headings, paragraphs, breaks, and lists. Semantic markup are things like making things bold, italicized, or underlining them. Semantics are important when needing to emphasize a word or sentence.
3. ****Work Summary****
    This week seemed a little less stressful than last week. I'm still getting the hang of some of the language of HTML, but I am definitely making progress. Using the book by Jon Duckett helps a lot too because not only are you gaining an understanding of the material but you get to see it and how it should or should not look.
