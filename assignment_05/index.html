<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>12 oz. log goat cheese, room temperature</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried Tarragon</li>
      <li>1 Tablespoon honey, plus some for garnish</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon sea salt</li>
      <li>pinch black pepper</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>1/2 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
      <li>1/2 cup all purpose flour</li>
      <li>salt and pepper as needed</li>
      <li>canola oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Mix together the goat cheese, tarragon, honey, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and pepper. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed. Roll into 12-14 balls (about an ounce each). You can make them as big or small as you want, especially if you want to yield more. Set aside until needed.</li>
      <li>Beat the egg and water in a small bowl.</li>
      <li>Add the breadcrumbs to a plate and season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Add the flour to a separate plate and season once more with salt and pepper. Create a dipping station with the flour first, egg second, then breadcrumbs.</li>
      <li>Roll the goat cheese balls in flour, dip in the egg, then roll in breadcrumbs. Shake off any excess breadcrumbs. Set on plate and continue until finished.</li>
      <li>If frying immediately, set in the freezer for <b>20-minutes</b>. If frying the next day or later in the day, set in the fridge for a minimum of 1-hour.</li>
      <li>When ready to fry, add enough canola oil to cover the surface of a Dutch oven by 3". Heat to <b><i>350 degrees</i></b>. Fry the goat cheese balls 4-5 at a time until golden and crispy.</li>
      <li>To garnish, drizzle with honey and a pinch of red pepper flakes (optional).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Notes:</p>
        <p>If you do not have a deep fryer or a thermometer, roll a few smaller balls with any excess goat cheese to test if the oil is hot enough. If the oil is not hot enough, the goat cheese will spill out of the balls.</p>
