### Questions

1. ****Describe any forms you've come across while browsing the web. What purposes do the serve?****
    Several forms I come across quite frequently are password inputs, text entry, and buttons. Pretty much any website you visit or use has these inputs. Even on shopping sites they all have a section where you can create an account and have to use text entry and password inputs to do that.

2. ****List examples of a text, selection, and button input, and where they might be used.****
    Since I am in the process or remodeling a new house, one of my favorite websites is wayfair.com . They have a search bar where you can search for almost any item you might need in your home and you can do this thanks to the text input of a search bar. Search bars are generally located at the top of a website throughout all of their pages so you can search for something on you mind at any given time.

3. ****Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.****
    This work cycle was again a little tricky for me but I think that I figured everything out.  Duckett's book really helped with any layout or code issues I was having, or I guess I should say helped put things in a different perspective for me so I could click all the pieces together. I really like how hands on this class is because I could never learn all these moving pieces without actually creating it on my own. Market on Front is by far one of my favorite food places in town, and if you haven't been to try out a breakfast burrito then you just missing out.
