### Homework Questions

1. ****Briefly describe the difference between divs, classes, ids, and spans.

      - Divs are use to group elements together, and they can be singular or nested and are used to insrease clarity within the structure of a page.
      - Classes groups similar types of elements together by using the same name, and they are used as identifiers and selector values for HTML groups.
      - Ids is considered a 'global identifier' and is used to identify specific and unique components.
      - Spans are attributes within divs, and are used to identify or group content together that requires organization or extra styling within a line.

2. ****What is "alt text," and why do we use it?
      - Alt text or Alt Attributes provide description of the contents of an image file, this is especially important for individuals who visit a page and can't see an image due to their browsers. Having this attribute on a page provides a description for the viewer.

3. ****Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.****
      - For some reason this week seemed a little easier than week 6. I did struggle with the video elements just a little but hopefully I finally figured that out.  I like being able to style a little bit more and more each week. I know that this is just a glimpse into what someone actually puts into styling of a page but I am excited to dive deeper into it.
