### Homework Questions

1. Briefly share your design process for this assignment. What fonts did you choose, and why?
      - I chose Alegreya font because it was similar to the font used in the actual books written by Cassandra Clare. I chose an excerpt from one of my favorite series that I believe is creatively written, and really helps your imagination soar just like web design.
2. What is the difference between a system font, web font, and web-safe font? What is the importance of having fallback fonts or a font stack?
    - System fonts are fonts that are already installed on your device or computer. Fonts that are already installed in Microsoft Word are a good example of this.
    - Web fonts are optimized for web use because they are consistent across most platforms, they usually generate from a web library such as Google Fonts, which is where I found my font for this assignment.
    - Web Safe Font are beneficial because most all devices will have this font, like Arial, Times New Roman, etc. They are consistent across Windows and Mac operating systems.
    - Fallback fonts in a font stack are important because if a browser can not load your primary font then it has other fonts in that family to fall back on in order to display your information to the user.
3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
    - I have a great handle on html documents, and so the process was fairly smooth in creating my main structure of my page. I however, am still really struggling with css and incorporating it properly into my html page. This may be because I am a little behind. I managed to get the color I wanted and the font to format correctly but I could not get my border to load at all so I gave up on that for the mean time and will try again next week.
