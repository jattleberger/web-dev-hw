### Homework Questions

1. Who was your imaginary client? How did they describe their site needs?
    - My imaginary client was a ranch, and they needed an earthy and homey feel to their website in order to
      show their potential customers that they care about their business and the interactions they have with others.

2. What is the difference between display: block, display: inline, and display: inline-block?
    - Display:inline - forces the property to act like and inline element and only takes up as much space as it needs to, doesn't force new lines, flows with content on the screen which means it doesn't respect the margin properties, and it can't change distance vertically or horizontally between itself and other elements.
    - display:inline-block - removes new lines that block elements but also forces elements to respect the margin and vertical spacing rules. These elements will fill the parent container so a specific width must be set
    - display:block - can be used to turn inline elements into block elements, this element is used when you need to create vertical navigation bars out of lists.

3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
    - I first chose and imaginary client to work with and decided what colors and feel that they might want for their site.
      Then I created my index, about, services, and contact html documents followed by my css document. Once structured I chose two fonts that I felt fit the feel my imaginary client might want. Chose earthy and homey colors that relate to nature and animals. Then I constructed my css document to design my html documents. I also chose 3 other ranch sites that I like and found placeholder images that correspond to my client and theme. Overall I am happy with my finished product.
